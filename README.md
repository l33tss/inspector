# SQL Injection Detector for Node.js ðŸš«ðŸ’‰

Hello there! This script is designed to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in your Node.js codebase. It's like having a friendly security guard for your code.

## ðŸš€ What it Does

The script recursively traverses through all `.js` files in your project, parses the JavaScript code to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and then looks for patterns that might indicate SQL injection vulnerabilities. If it finds any, it will print a warning to the console. Think of this as a first line of defense against sneaky SQL injections.
